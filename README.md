## Summary
:warning: Archived Project for Portfolio Purposes :warning:

Vanguard Health Insurance / GoMediQuote after our success with their first site, [Vanguard Health Insurance](https://github.com/kamst01/vanguard_health_insurance), came to me to accompany the first site with a sister site. The first sites goal was to acquire clients through telephone, this is by online form and then telephone.

This is the first website I had to create where the design, colors, logos and direction was already taken care of by the client.

This project was turned around in 1 month 24 days from initial discussion to website live.

## Purpose
Create a website for Vanguard Health Insurance / GoMediQuote to provide potential insurance plans to potential customers online instead of over the phone. This website will be strictly used for online targeted ads.

## Technologies

### PHP
This was my first time ever using PHP in anything in general.

### Wordpress
Wordpress was used as the original plan was the client would write blog pages, press pages and update the side in the moment. The client also provided and required use of a very specific plugin for form / lead generation in order to comply with US government laws and keep users data protected. Only one plugin was used on this site.

### Webhooks
This is my first project ever using webhooks to send the provided phone number in the form, and then send said phone number to an employee in a call center. This was used using Zapier and custom Wordpress Web Hooks.

### Bootstrap
This is my second site on production level using Bootstrap and it continued to provide and automate a lot of design processes with CSS.

## What I learned
- PHP is very powerful
- A/B testing the form, you can lose potential customers on the first step!
- Colors can make or break how a customer feels about a website.
- Linking away from websites to quality information can help provide trust to customers.
- Compressing images does not always provide the fastest and best quality solution.
